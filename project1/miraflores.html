        <p class="main-p">While in Lima, visitors can head to Miraflores, a popular city next to the coast. It is one of 
            Lima's most popular tourist destinations and is known for its breathtaking coast views, high-end 
            shopping, and delicious foods. It is located on a clifftop, which allows visitors to see the 
            beautiful Pacific Ocean. A great place to visit in Miraflores is its famous boardwalk, which 
            stretches nearly 10 kilometers along the coast. The boardwalk is a nice escape from the bustling 
            city and great for leisure.

        <p class="main-p">Those who prefer something more exciting can participate in multiple 
            fun activities on the beach, such as paragliding and surfing. Visitors can soar above the coastal 
            cliffs for amazing views of Miraflores, and surfing enthusiasts can surf waves at Makaha and 
            Waikiki Beach. Parque Kennedy is also a great place to visit while in Miraflores. It is a vibrant 
            and lively urban park popular with tourists. There are various street performances to see and 
            many stray cats to pet. There are also multiple food vendors selling snacks to indulge in. </p>
