        <h2> Lima Main Square</h2>
        <img src="images/archbishop-palace-cathedral.jpg" alt="cathedral" class="hist-pics" id="cathedral">

        <p class="main-p">One of the most famous historical landmarks in Lima is the Historic Center of Lima. It is located 
            in the center of Lima and is also known as the "Ciudad de los Reyes." Founded by Francisco 
            Pizarro in 1535, it was the center of Spanish power during Spanish colonial rule. The Lima Main 
            Square is located within the historic center and remains the heart of the city to this day. The 
            square is surrounded by beautifully constructed buildings like the Government Palace, the Lima 
            Metropolitan Cathedral, the Archbishop's Palace, and the Municipal Palace.

        <img src="images/government palace.jpg" alt="palace" class="hist-pics" id="palace">
        <p class="main-p">While at the Historic Center, visitors can enter the cathedral of Lima and view the intricate and stunning architecture. 
            Visitors can also access the religious art museum within the cathedral, which is filled with 
            paintings, sculptures, furniture, jewelry, sacred vessels, antique religious vestments, and robes of 
            former archbishops.

        <img src="images/chinatown-street.jpg" alt="chinatown" class="hist-pics" id="chinatown">
        <p class="main-p">Another thing to do in the main square is view the changing of the guard in 
            front of the Government Palace. This martial ceremony began in the 1940s and occurs daily at 
            noon and 6 pm. After a long day of seeing the sites, visitors can head to Chinatown to enjoy a 
            Chinese Peruvian culinary fusion called 'chifa'.</p>
